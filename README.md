# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

## User Stories

1. As a user,  
So that I can see what other people are saying,  
I want to be able to see all the messages (peeps).  

2. As a user,  
So that I can let people know what I am doing,  
I want to post a message (peep) to Chitter

3. As a user,
So that I can have an account and log in,  
I want to be able to create a user account

4. As a user,  
So that I can only post messages as me,  
I want to be able to log in to Chitter

5. As a user,
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me,  
I want to log out of Chitter

6. As a user, 
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep,  
I want to see the time at which it was made


## Utilities you might find useful

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the API.
